#---- Travelsal is the process of going through the array elements one by one
#----To traverse an array in Python, you use a loop.

#--- There are three important reasons for travelsal

#Types of Arrays Operations
#1-Insertion : Insertion refers to the process of adding a new element to an array (list in Python) at a specific position.
#---- Insertion with append() built-in python method, add element at the end. O(1)
array_1 = [1,2,3,4]
array_1.append(5)
array_1
#---- Insertion with intert() built-in python method, add element at any position. O(n), it require shifting each of the existing elemnts to the right
array_2 = [1,2,3,4]
array_2.insert(2,5)

##---- Insertion with slicing, not built in methods. O(n) complexity, slice imply to create a new list by copying the element,concatenation is also o(n)

#Types of Arrays Operations
#1-Deletion : Deleting element from the array.
#---- Deletion with del statement:it removes the specified element(s) from the list.

example = [1,2,3,4]
del example[2]
example

#---- Deletion with remove method:it removes the first occurrence of a specified value from the list.

example = [1,2,3,4]
example.remove(4)
example

#---- Deletion with pop method:it removes and returns the element at a given index.

example = [1,2,3,4]
example.pop(0)
example

#--- Note: all deletion methods requires shifting all the elements to the right of the delete element to the left so it require O(n)

#Types of Arrays Operations
#1-Searching : where you look for the presence of an element within the array.It involves checking each element of the array until you find the desired one or conclude that it's not present

#Linear Searh Algorithm (Sequencial Search)
#---It checks every element of the array one by one. O(n)
# #Here is the algorithm
# ---1.Start at the beginning: Begin at the first element of the list.
# ---2.Check each element in turn: Compare the current element with the element you're searching for.
# ---3.If a match is found: Return the index of the element or indicate that the element is found.
# ---4.If the end of the list is reached: If you reach the end of the list without finding the element, conclude that the element is not present in the list.

#Binary Search Algorithm (Sequencial Search)
#---Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one. O(logn)
# #Here is the algorithm
# ---1.Compare the middle element: Check if the middle element of the array is equal to the target element
# ---2.Left or Right: If the target element is smaller, narrow the search to the left half of the array, otherwise to the right half.
# ---3.Repeat: Continue the process on the new half-array until the element is found or the subarray size becomes zero.
# Initial Setup: Start with two pointers, typically called low and high, at the beginning and end of the array respectively.

# Find the Middle: In each step, look at the middle element of the array (or sub-array). The middle element is found by mid = low + (high - low) // 2.

# Compare with the Target:

# If the middle element is equal to the target, you've found the item.
# If it's less than the target, adjust the low pointer to mid + 1.
# If it's greater than the target, adjust the high pointer to mid - 1.
# Repeat or Conclude: Repeat these steps until the low pointer exceeds the high pointer, which means the element isn't in the array.

def binarySearch(array,searchingValue):

##-- Selection sorting 
# Start with the first element of the array as the minimum.

# Repeat the above steps until the array is sorted.

# Two Pointer Approach
# Understanding Two-Pointer Approach:
# What It Is: It involves two references (pointers or indices) that move through an array (or linked list) to solve a problem. These pointers can move in the same direction, opposite directions, or can be used for different purposes.

# 1. Opposite Direction Pattern
# Scenario: Finding a pair with a specific sum in a sorted array.

        elif current_sum < target:
            right -= 1
        elif current_sum > target:
            left +=1
