"""
Merge Sort for Sorting an Array of Objects:

Suppose you have an array of objects where each object has two fields: name and age. Use Merge Sort to sort the array first by age, and if two objects have the same age, then by name. This problem will help you understand how to customize the comparison logic in Merge Sort.

Input: [{name: "John", age: 25}, {name: "Jane", age: 22}, {name: "Bob", age: 25}]
Output: [{name: "Jane", age: 22}, {name: "Bob", age: 25}, {name: "John", age: 25}]
