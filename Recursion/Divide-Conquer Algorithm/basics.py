"""
1- Divide problem into several smaller problems, normally the problems are similar to the original

2- Conquer/solve the subproblems by solving them recursively Base Case: Solve small enough problems by bruteforce

3- Combine the solutions to get the solution to the subproblems and finally a solution to the original problem

4- Divide and conquer algorithms are normally recursive
